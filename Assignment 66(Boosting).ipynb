    "Q10. What is the effect of increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- Increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost algorithm can have a number of effects, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased accuracy: As the number of estimators increases, the accuracy of the model typically increases. This is because the weak learners are able to learn from each other's mistakes and improve their predictions over time.\n",
    "2. Increased complexity: The model will also become more complex as the number of estimators increases. This can make the model more difficult to understand and interpret.\n",
    "3. Increased computational complexity: The training time of the model will also increase as the number of estimators increases. This is because the model has to be trained multiple times, once for each weak learner.\n",
    "4. Increased risk of overfitting: If the number of estimators is too high, the model may start to overfit the data. This means that the model will become too good at predicting the training data, but it will not be as good at predicting new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal number of estimators will depend on the specific problem. In general, it is a good idea to start with a small number of estimators and then increase the number of estimators until the accuracy of the model starts to plateau.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some additional considerations when increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost:\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate of the algorithm may need to be adjusted as the number of estimators increases. A lower learning rate may be required to prevent the model from overfitting the data.\n",
    "The stopping criteria may also need to be adjusted. The algorithm may need to be run for more iterations if the number of estimators is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost can be a good way to improve the accuracy of the model. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks of overfitting and to adjust the hyperparameters of the algorithm accordingly."
